# WebDevI_Holidae_Web-Development-Project_A2
 This is an assignment - website project coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I structured the code in separate sections for structure, styling, and behaviour. I used semantic HTML, uniform CSS design, and basic JavaScript elements. I included HTML comments to describe how and why each section was created for academic review.
